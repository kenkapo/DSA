RECURRENCE RELATION->
TO WRITE 1D recurrence relation do the following steps->
1.express the problem in terms of index.
2.do all possible stuffs on the index according to the question.
3.return the thing that the problem is asking for.

SPACE OPTIMISATION->
IF THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE index-1 OR index-2 THEN THERE CAN BE ALWAYS SPACE OPTIMISATION.

TABULATION->
1.declare the dp array of same size as declared in memoisation.
2.base case becomes initialisation.
3.whatever you write for recursion , write the opposite for tabulation i.e the direction of loops will become opposite.
4.In memoisation and tabulation, we declare the space same as that of changing parameters i.e. if there is 1 changing parameter ,then make 1d array. If there are 2 changing parameters then make 2d array.
